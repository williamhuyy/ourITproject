      <h5 class="pt-3 pl-4">1. Overview</h5>
      <b class="pt-3 pl-5">• Topic</b>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">In a restless world, most people seem to ignore their health by fasting and just concentrate
        on their
        study, work or taking care of their family because they did not have time to eat properly. Whereas some are more
        likely to
        become lazy and all they do is eat and rest the whole day without any outdoor activities. From that, many types
        of diseases
        were born such as obesity, malnutrition, and appendicitis. Therefore, we would like to create an application
        which helps
        users to have a healthy lifestyle with balanced diet and beneficial body exercises by providing services like
        body measurement
        to select appropriate diets and activities suitable for the users.
      </p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">If this project becomes successful, we hope to reduce the number of people with poor physical
        health
        worldwide. Moreover, this application is also expected to have significant advantages for the medical industry
        as it
        collects and stores data which will be delivered to the World Health Organization.
      </p>
      <b class="pt-3 pl-5">• Motivation</b>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">Physical health is human’s most valuable asset because without it, there is no energy and
        strength for
        humans to work at all. Apparently, people would be more likely to be careless about their health and eventually
        they will
        have some serious illnesses. This is also our group project's main motivation as we believe that our project
        will be able
        to help a lot of people who have poor physical health. Moreover, we want to contribute to the development of the
        health
        sector by providing advanced technologies.
      </p>
      <b class="pt-3 pl-5">• Landscape</b>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">Making a health application specifically physical health is a common idea among potential
        developers
        around the world. Therefore, ideas being duplicated and creating similar applications are inevitable situations.
        There are
        a number of apps that are identical to our project idea such as: Noom, MyPlate Calories Counter,etc. In order to
        solve
        this problem, our application is required to have uniqueness in functions or design. But because of the sheer
        number of
        apps, we can not tell if those apps already have that functionality or not. As a result, we would use some
        features like
        a live chat box with professional doctors or an AI assistant that remind users to do their tasks in exercises
        and eating
        routine. In detail, live chat box will provide live chatting with doctors during office hours for users to seek
        advice or
        questions that they want to ask directly at home without going to the clinic. And an AI assistant will not only
        remind
        users when the time has come to do the task but it will also include some encouraging words to motivate users.
        However,
        since we are still newbies in the IT field, it is not easy to add those features into the app. So we would do
        more
        research on how to implement those functions and hopefully we could accomplish it in the future.
      </p>
      <h5 class="pt-3 pl-4">2. Detailed Description</h5>
      <b class="pt-3 pl-5">• Aims </b>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">Obesity has become a global epidemic for decades and it causes many negative effects
        toward the human
        body. According to WHO: “
      </span>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">- “Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975.</span>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">- In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these
        over 650 million
        were obese.
      </span>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">- 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and 13% were obese.</span>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">- Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more
        people than
        underweight.
      </span>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">- 38 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2019.</span>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">- Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in
        2016.</span>
      <br>
      <span class="pl-5 pr-4">- Obesity is preventable. ” [1]</span>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4 pt-2">Although obesity is a health problem which most people get around the world, it is not
        difficult to search
        for solutions to prevent as well as curing this illness. Therefore, our group intention is to create an
        application that could
        help users to select their proper diet and exercises for their body in order to lose weight. In specific, we
        have two main
        goals for this project. One would be providing a diverse menu of diet and exercise plans so that users can have
        a wide range
        of choices which suit their body condition best. Another goal is to reduce the amount of overweight people
        globally and help
        the health care industry to develop.
      </p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">Suppose this project could not be able to complete due to the time limitation, the most
        important outcome
        that we expected to output is for the user to lose weight successfully with our plans. Nothing is more important
        than improving
        health and this is also our number one priority when implementing the project. Everyone can lose weight without
        exercising
        because with a variety of diet menus, people can choose which diet is effective for them as humans need to eat
        so as to live.
        Not everyone can spend time to go to the gym and get fit or even exercise at home since most people are too busy
        with their
        work, studies or taking care of their family. Therefore, we are more likely to concentrate on the diet menu
        rather than the
        exercise plans.

      </p>
      <b class="pt-3 pl-5">• Plans and Progress </b>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">At the beginning of the project, we started by dividing the project into two parts: report
        writing and
        creating the application. We assigned each member to work on different parts of the project. For the
        application, two people
        will create contents, specifically searching for numerous diet plans and exercises to put into the application.
        The other two
        members will work on forming the app, in other words they will make and design the basic outline for it. About
        the report,
        since it contains many parts that need to be written, we divide each person an equal amount of sections that one
        person has to
        write. Next up, we created a Github group repository so that everyone can have access and contribute their work
        in it. We also
        set up a google document for members to insert their writing for the report. For most of the time, we
        communicate with one
        another via Facebook Messenger in our group chat, where we plan, inform what each of us have done throughout the
        week and
        exchange information about the project. We used to make an appointment so that the whole team could meet up and
        discuss
        further about how this project would be completed. However, some problems occurred such as there was a member
        who said that
        he was sick and could not participate in the meeting. Another member said that he also could not attend the
        meeting due to his
        personal family issues. Therefore, we decided to meet each other in the tutorial class because it is much easier
        to do so.
      </p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">Everything was proceeding very well as everyone of us participated and made small effort for
        the assignment
        day by day. Suddenly, one of our members determined to leave the group by reason of incompatible working styles.
        Because that
        member left the group abruptly, we fell into a state of confusion where we do not know what to do next. The
        member who left
        was considered as the core of the group as she led us and told us what to do. Moreover, the project idea also
        belongs to her
        so that she is the person who can visualize the expected outcome of the work. With the deadline for submissions
        coming close,
        we had no choice but to continue with this project since we do not have enough time to think and create another
        practical
        project like this application. We would change a few aspects of the idea so that it will be different from the
        original one
        to avoid plagiarism. And since the number of members have been cut down from four to three, we have to speed up
        the progress
        of the work as we need to cover the leaver remaining parts. Not only were we exhausted from increasing the
        amount of work, but
        our mental health was affected with stress and pressure. However, we are still trying hard to complete the
        assignment and we
        also comfort as well as motivate each other to work harder.
      </p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">Since there is not much time left and having membership shortage with loads of work need to
        be done, three
        main jobs will be divided as one will write the remaining parts of the report, one will create the group website
        and set up
        Github repository and the last one will work on making the basic features of the app. We hope that we can finish
        all of the
        work before the deadline and for the presentation, we will make Powerpoint slides, record our voices and then we
        will use a
        screen-recording software and a video editor to insert our voices into the video.
