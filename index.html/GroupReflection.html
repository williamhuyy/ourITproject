      <p class="pl-5 pr-4 pb-5 pt-3">Quang: After doing all the things, I think that my contribution to this project is
        quite
        important when a demo of this project is made on my own. I have to get used to using Figma and find out how to
        use that application, it is quite hard at the beginning when I have not known about Figma before. Moreover, I
        also have to find ideas to decorate applications which consume a lot of time and make me exhausted. However, I
        think every members’ contribution is equally important, like Huy he will make a powerpoint which also needs to
        be planned and decorated, while Van has to complete our report, consuming a lot of time on writing and using
        grammar as well as ideas. After this course, I know how to use Github obviously and Figma as a gift which is an
        interesting thing in this course. Moreover, I also learnt about groups that you have to be responsible for your
        part and keep in touch with other members. Self-learning and searching are skills that I also gained in this
        course too, and I think in the future I need to improve my responsibility when there are some moments when I am
        lazy and not try to do my job and finish it as soon as possible. Overall, my team still completed this project
        at the right time which is a lucky thing. However, from my perspective, communication is still the skill that
        every member needs to improve after working together honestly. Thanks for working together and good luck in the
        future.</p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4 pb-5">Van: After everything is done, I am satisfied with the group work and the project was
        completed right on time. Everybody in the team did their parts well and on schedule along with the group website
        is perfectly designed, the powerpoint for presentation is neatly composed and the application testing went well.
        It is also a fortune that I am able to work with such friendly and hardworking teammates like Huy and Quang.
        Thanks to them, I was able to talk comfortably and freely because I am quite shy when interacting with new
        people. If possible, we hope to improve the communication between the members by holding meetings or being more
        active on social media where we talk to each other. Another thing that we wished to be better is that for most
        of the time, we talked to each other through social media and did not meet in class very often. Therefore, I
        hoped that in the future, by any chance we are teammates again, we would hold meetings more regularly to ensure
        the efficiency of group work. And as mentioned above, the most surprising thing of the project was one of the
        members left the group. Overall, I personally learned a lot through this assessment such as do not be inactive
        to the group and ỉmproving my writing skills. Other than that, I have learned a great lesson that I should not
        be inactive in communicating with other members because it causes a lot of problems such as lack of solidarity
        among teammates, etc. </p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4 pb-5">Huy: Despite the withdrawal of our team leader, our team still stood firm. Everyone in
        the group still remained friendly and we could still continue working together. Because our team consisted of 3
        members for the final assignment, which means that we lacked human resources. So each and every member of the
        team had to work really hard on their assigned tasks, and made their best efforts to get their jobs done. If
        it's the one thing that should be improved within this group it would be improving the working style of our
        group members, because everyone has their deadlines, other work that needs to be focused on, not to mention the
        procrastination as well so to be able to have a smooth workflow is not easy at all. The one thing that surprised
        me the most is that although there was the lack of communication and the assistance from a fourth teammate, we
        were still able to get our work done on time. After the departure of our old team leader, I was the one who got
        assigned the leader role. Thanks to the incident, I was able to have a better understanding of what to do when
        leading a team to work on a project. I am thankful to get to work along with these amazing people.</p>
