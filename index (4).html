      <p class="pl-5 pr-4 pt-3">Quang: After working with my team for nearly 10 weeks, although there are many arguments
        among us and one member leaving the team, we are still working well together. Late in meeting or completing
        their own work is unavoidable, however it is clearly improved day by day. In the very first days, our team did
        not communicate with each other very well, when someone chatted on Messenger, our team tended to ignore it which
        made the one who message confused a lot and because of that, one member left the group obviously. After that
        accident, our team realized how important that communication takes place in teamwork, so we try to communicate
        more and more which is a good sign for not only in this project but in the future. About Van, she is an
        enthusiastic girl who interacts well with other team members, she is responsible for our report so her part is
        completed very quickly. Another teammate is Huy, after that member who could be seen as a captain left group,
        Huy is in charge and leads us to complete this project. Because he is the oldest one so he knows how to work as
        a team, thanks to him so that our project could reach this far. After all, every member in the team has learnt a
        lot not only knowledge on school but also how to work together, not sure that we can work together in the future
        but I will remember these memories and experiences a lot.</p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4">Van: The submission deadline is getting close and overall, my team did a great job in this
        assignment despite many problems occured. In the beginning, my team did not show good teamwork because of lack
        of communication and as a result, the group did not have solidarity. Afterwards, there was a shortage of members
        in the group as one member decided to leave. At first, we were shocked and panicked because within a short
        period of time, we have to cover both the leaving member parts and our own parts of the project with just three
        members. However, since Huy is the oldest member, he has replaced the leadership position of the former member
        and he led the group very well as he assigned work evenly for all three members. And from there, I and Quang
        followed his directions and finished our parts on time and we have done a great job to contribute to the
        project.</p>
      <p class="pl-5 pr-4 pb-5">Despite our shortcomings with the departure of our group leader on the day of our group
        presentation, I felt that as a group we have recovered extremely well. In the beginning, everyone in the group
        had their own deadlines for other courses to chase so the Introduction to IT project was put on the back burner.
        After our leader left us, I took up the intiative to recover the group’s morale and re-distributed the workload
        amongst the three of us. Quang really impressed us by producing an exceptionally high quality User Interface
        (UI) mock-up for the fitness application as it looked just like the real thing. Even though Van is a reserved
        individual, she is extremely hardworking and really prepared well for her presentation slides. I contributed
        with editing the group’s video presentation and managed our group’s github website.</p>
